NORMAL.DOTM: THE VIMRC OF MICROSOFT WORD
========================================
Every new document will use Normal.dotm file as the base template.

The Normal.dotm file is located in
/Users/bokwoon/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content.localized/Templates.localized/

It is VITAL you edit Normal.dotm from within Word itself or you will not be able to open Normal.dotm at all, merely open a new Untitled Document.
    The ‘Library’ folder is actually hidden in Microsoft Word’s file browser, but you can get around it by dragging and dropping the folder from Finder into the file browser in Microsoft Word.

Preferably you can drag the Normal.dotm file from https://github.com/bokwoon95/.emacs.d/tree/master/emacs%20in%20msword into above Templates.localized folder and have everything work out of the box. If not you'll have to record the macros for each shortcut manually, which is REALLY tedious.

Seems like dragging the Normal.dotm imports nothing, so you'll have to manually import the NewMacros.bas visual basic macro script into Normal.dotm itself.
    Tools>Macros>Visual Basic Editor
        Right Click Normal>Import File>Select NewMacros.bas in ~/.emacs.d/emacs-msword/
Then, to assign a keyboard shortcut to each macro:
    Tools>Customize Keyboard>Macros
        Select each macro and input the corresponding keyboard shortcut

ComplementaryDeletion
----------------------
DeleteForwardChar DeleteForwardWord
KillTilEndofLine KillTilStartofLine
-caveat: 'KillTilEndOfLine' Selects til end of line and MOVES BACK BY ONE so you don't delete the newline character as well. Very annoying behaviour if the newline character keeps getting killed, results in a lot of unwanted joining of sentences.

4) Sane bullet indentation
Microsoft Word's default bullet indentation is too wide! Shrink it down to these dimensions(Mac only)
follow these guides: they're not perfect but they will provide most of the details
